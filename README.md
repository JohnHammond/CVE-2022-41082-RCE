# TimWallbey/CVE-2022-41082-RCE is an illegitimate scam

This original repository is riding off of the hype and FUD coming from the new Microsoft Exchange 0-day vulnerabilities, advertising a fake and illegitimate scam "available for purchase" on Satoshi Disk.

I reported this user and the repository and created an Issue within the repository to raise awareness for potential victims. 
TimWallbey then _removed_ the Issues from the Github repository so this is no longer visible.

This fork does nothing but continue to shine the spotlight on this scam after the scammer doubled-down and tried to mask the malicious intent.

GitHub, please do something about repositories that claim to have tooling for sale after the breakout news of a new 0-day vulnerability and exploit.
